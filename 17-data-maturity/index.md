# What Is Data Maturity?

Data maturity refers to the degree to which an organisation can trust, access, and make use of its data in consistent, scalable, and repeatable ways. It is not a single milestone but a spectrum, moving from ad hoc storage and reactive use of data to intentional, systematic, and strategic data practices.

Rather than focusing purely on technology, data maturity is shaped by processes, responsibilities, and infrastructure that allow an organisation to treat data as a first-class operational asset.

## Where Is Your Data Stored?

A foundational question is where data resides. Many teams start with spreadsheets, SaaS dashboards, or siloed internal systems. As maturity increases, organisations begin to bring together operational data into clearly defined, queryable storage environments. This might include databases, shared repositories, or cloud storage, supported by structure and schema.

Storage maturity includes:

* Consistent format and location of raw and processed data
* Known data retention policies
* Versioning and audit trails

If your team cannot quickly answer the question "Where can I find the latest version of this dataset?", this is often a sign of early-stage maturity.

## Do You Use External Services?

Third-party tooling (for surveys, analytics, support tickets, marketing etc.) introduces dependencies. Mature organisations know which systems they rely on and understand the shape, latency, and access controls of externally held data.

This does not imply avoiding external services. Rather, it involves:

* Tracking where data lives
* Having a plan for backup or data export
* Assessing the quality and completeness of third-party data

This is particularly relevant when archiving important records or gathering insight from patterns and trends contained within multiple data sources over time.

## Can You Rerun Data Collection?

Surveys, product telemetry, and transactional systems all produce data. A high-maturity system can regenerate these collection steps under version control.

Examples include:

* Replaying survey distribution to similar audiences
* Reproducing a customer cohort definition
* Rerunning metrics or aggregation from raw inputs

If you treat data as a one-time output of human action, you will struggle to scale analysis or trust derived insights. Mature organisations treat data collection as part of a pipeline, not a static event.

## Are Things Reproducible?

Increased data maturity correlates with higher reproducibility. This means you can:

* Trace a dashboard value back to its source data and transformation logic
* Compare year-on-year metrics with confidence in underlying definitions
* Apply the same analytical steps to new features, markets, or time periods

Reproducibility supports review and comparison. It allows organisations to understand whether trends are real or artefacts of changing methodology. It also enables reuse of analysis across new product launches or operational changes, provided the same structure of data is captured.

## Who "Owns" the Data?

In low-maturity environments, data tends to be owned by individuals. A particular analyst knows how to export it, or a product manager has a copy on their laptop. This is fragile and leads to inconsistency.

Mature organisations treat data as the **outcome of processes**. Ownership is shifted toward systems and roles, not individuals. For example:

* A customer support pipeline emits structured data into a central store
* A CI/CD job produces logs into a searchable index
* A marketing campaign writes results into a tracked repository

This shift enables onboarding, collaboration, and systemic improvement.

## Other Signals of Maturity

A few additional patterns indicate maturing data infrastructure:

* **Metadata management**: Naming, ownership, and schema of datasets are known and searchable
* **Monitoring**: Alerting on missing, delayed, or anomalous data flows
* **Governance**: Access controls, compliance with regulations, and data lifecycle management
* **Data products**: Datasets or APIs treated as reusable assets across teams

These practices are not binary. Instead, they emerge progressively as teams learn from operational pain and invest in infrastructure accordingly.

## A Checklist for Data Maturity

You do not need to answer "yes" to all of the below to be considered mature, but the more you can affirm, the more resilient your data operations likely are:

* Stakeholders can access data without needing a call
* Strategic initiatives are visible in metrics
* You have the option to move to different providers of a service
* New metrics are an opportunity not a challenge
* Archived data is structured for long-term access and comparison
* Access permissions reflect roles and regulatory requirements
* Data definitions are kept close to where the data lives (e.g. metadata, schema, readme files)

## Signs You Might Be Struggling

It is common to encounter one or more of these pain points in early-stage organisations:

* Only one person knows how a number was calculated
* Data is downloaded manually and emailed or pasted into slides
* Teams produce inconsistent results using the same inputs
* Name changes cause failure
* Metrics are open to interpretation by different teams
* Data loss or overwrites go unnoticed until something breaks

None of these are failures in isolation. They are signals that your data infrastructure has not yet adapted to the needs of your organisation. Recognising these gaps is the first step towards better systems.

## Summary

AI/ML systems are often appealing, but they remain impractical for organisations with low data maturity. Before pursuing advanced analytics or automation, it is worth reviewing how your data is collected, stored, and used. Solid data practices not only support long-term ambitions, they also provide immediate value in visibility, consistency, and decision-making.
