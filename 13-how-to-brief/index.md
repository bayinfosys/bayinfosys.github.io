# How to Brief a Developer on a Feature Without Being Technical

As a business or product owner, you don't need to speak code to collaborate with an AI engineer - just communicate clearly.
This article is a practical guide to doing just that.
When the business and technical sides share a mutual understanding of goals, expectations, and limitations, projects move faster, avoid misalignment, and yield better outcomes.
Many AI projects fail not due to tech problems, but due to confusion, withheld information, or unclear objectives.
Honest, structured dialogue from the beginning sets the tone for success.

## Start with Outcomes, Inputs, and Constraints

Before development starts, define the minimum viable outcome you're aiming for.
Be specific. What's the smallest version of the feature that would still deliver value?
Then, outline what you can provide: data, timelines, subject matter expertise, and what you expect the team to handle.
A good developer will tell you what they need, from third-party accounts to specific formats of data.
Communicating constraints clearly helps set realistic expectations, and ensures everyone is working within the same guardrails.
Remember, constraints aren't obstacles, they're the structure that makes delivery achievable.

## Clarity, Use Cases, and Measurable Goals

To guide the work and avoid surprises, everyone involved needs to be aligned on three things:
+ "Can you give examples of what you want?"
+ "Can we agree on a roadmap to get there?", and
+ "How will we know it's working?"

At this point roadmaps are invaluable to translate constraints into goals.
Metrics then define what success looks like.
When both sides agree on these from the outset, it becomes far easier to steer the project, build trust, and confirm progress along the way.

## What Developers Wish Founders Knew

Technical challenges are rarely the hardest part: shifting goals, unclear requests, and vague expectations are far more disruptive.
Developers value specificity.
Instead of "make it smarter," say, "we want the system to flag 90% of errors before submission." Good examples are golden.
Developers also appreciate being included early in strategic conversations, especially where business goals may shape technical decisions.
Mutual respect, timely feedback, and consistent planning build the strongest collaborations.

## A Template for a Solid AI Brief

Use the checklist below to structure your conversations and briefs.
Thinking about these points will give you a massive head start:

+ Project Goal
    + What is the purpose of this feature or model?
    + What business problem is it solving?
+ Inputs
    + What data is available?
    + Where does the data come from?
    + Who owns the data and how reliable is it?
+ Desired Outputs
    + What should the model/system return?
    + How will this output be used in your product or service?
+ Success Criteria
    + What does success look like?
    + Are there metrics or benchmarks (e.g., accuracy, latency)?
+ Constraints
    + Timeframe and budget
    + Regulatory/privacy constraints
    + Technical limitations (e.g., deployment environment, compute limits)
+ Examples
    + Provide real examples of expected input/output pairs
    + Include edge cases or undesirable outcomes if relevant
+ Integration Context
    + Where in the product flow does this feature live?
    + How will users interact with the results?
+ Risks and Uncertainties
    + What assumptions are being made?
    + What might go wrong or be hard to predict?
+ Communication Plan
    + Who is the main point of contact?
    + How often will you review progress or changes?
+ Versioning and Iteration
    + Are there multiple phases? What are the v1 vs v2 goals?

Bonus Tip: Always end your brief with a simple open question: "What else do you need from me to get started confidently?"

## Final Thoughts

Writing a good AI brief doesn't require deep technical knowledge, just a thoughtful understanding of your own goals, limits, and business context.
A clear, structure saves time, reduces stress, and often produces better results. More importantly, it shows commitment - and that's when the best work happens.
