# SaaS Architecture 101 for Scalability - A Guide for Non-CTOs

If you're a non-technical founder building a SaaS product, conversations about architecture can feel like alphabet soup: LAMP, MERN, JAMstack, microservices, serverlessâ€”you name it.
This article gives you a simplified overview of the key architectural choices you'll encounter and how to navigate them confidently with your engineering team.

## What is the SaaS Stack?

The "SaaS stack" refers to the set of technologies used to build and run software-as-a-service platforms.
At its core, this includes a front end (what the user sees), a backend (the business logic), data storage, and infrastructure for hosting and deployment.

Classic stacks include:

+ LAMP: Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP. A common stack in early 2000s.
+ MEAN: MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, Node.js.
+ MERN: A modern variant using React instead of Angular.
+ JAMstack: JavaScript, APIs, and Markup; often used for static sites with headless CMSs.

Each stack has its own trade-offs and use cases, and it's perfectly fine to Google these as you encounter them.
The important thing is to align your stack with your team's experience and your product's needs.

## Key Architectural Decision: Monolith vs Microservices

One of the first choices you'll face is whether to go with a monolith or microservices.
This is about how your product grows and how your team works.

Monoliths are faster to build and simpler to manage early on. All your code lives in one place, which makes debugging and deploying easier.

Microservices split your system into smaller, focused components that can scale independently.

Both can add complexity and result in failure with the wrong experience, so try not to force any choices.

## Infrastructure

Whether you're using AWS, GCP, or another cloud provider, your stack will rely on underlying infrastructure: servers, databases, storage, CI/CD pipelines, etc.
Evaluate your options:
+ Cost: Is there a free tier? What does scaling cost?
+ Lock-in risk: Are you tied to one vendor?
+ Alternatives: Could an open-source solution do the job better (or cheaper)?

Each of these risks balance out the other, by comparing alternatives you will understand the value proposition of each.
Remember: not everything is glamorous. Features like logging, authentication, and billing don't make headlines, but they are essential and can be the difference between buy or build.

## Cloud Costs: Friend or Foe?

Cloud has a reputation for being expensive but this is often down to careless use.
Most providers offer generous free tiers and low-cost services for startups.
What kills budgets are unused resources, inefficient setups, or no cost monitoring.

Set up budget alerts. Monitor usage. Keep things simple. With a small team and smart defaults, you can operate powerful applications for next to nothing.

## Talk to Your Engineers

You need to know how to ask: "Why are we choosing this tool?" and "What happens if this breaks?"

Ask for a roadmap. It doesn't need to be precise, but it should tell you:

+ What's being built
+ Why it matters
+ How long it might take

Engineers appreciate when founders ask good questions and focus on user value. It shows you're serious about outcomes.

It's also good for everyone to get a second opinion and a fresh perspective.

## Final Thoughts

Building a SaaS product means knowing how to collaborate.
If you're not sure whether your choices are sound, or if you're in that early stage of "what should we use?" - reach out.
I'm always happy to review plans and help you build a strong technical foundation that fits your product, your team, and your budget.
