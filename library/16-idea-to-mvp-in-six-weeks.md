From Idea to MVP in 6 Weeks

Intro:
Many founders have strong ideas for AI products. Often, the challenge is not creativity, but knowing how to begin—how to move forward without committing too much time or money too soon. This article outlines a six-week structure for building an early version of your product. The focus is on useful, working results. Each stage aims to clarify your thinking, reduce technical risk, and give you something you can show.

Key Paragraphs:

Week 1: Define problem and success metric – Begin by describing the task clearly: what role will the AI play, and how will it help the user? It's useful to write this in plain terms—something you could say out loud to someone without explaining jargon. You also need a way to check if you're on the right track. Does the feature run? Can people try it? Does it improve something meaningful, like decision speed or quality? Tools like SMART goals (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound) can help if you're unsure where to begin.

Week 2: Collect data or locate datasets – Start by looking inward: what data does your company already collect? You might find chat logs, customer feedback, click paths, or transactions. If there’s nothing usable, look outward—public datasets, open APIs, or even web scraping may be enough for early tests. Synthetic data can also be helpful if the task is structured and repeatable.

Week 3–4: Model selection and iteration – You don’t always need to build from scratch. General-purpose models from providers like OpenAI or Hugging Face are often enough to test ideas. However, not every problem fits this mould. Some tasks are too specific, others require lower latency or simpler models. Early evaluation should focus on things that affect use: accuracy, response time, cost to run. If something goes wrong, it's fine to step back and try again. When user numbers are small, it’s often easier to catch failures manually. This phase can take a few rounds to get right.

Week 5: Demo integration – Once something works, wrap it in a simple demo. This doesn’t mean a full product. It means a place to test the result. It might be a basic web form, or a notebook with buttons. Avoid command-line tools unless your audience is technical. The demo should let others see what the system does, not how it works.

Week 6: Stakeholder feedback and pivot – At this point, people will want to see what you’ve built. Prepare to explain what the system does, why you chose the approach you did, and what happened during testing. Be open about what’s missing or limited. Often, this is the moment when expectations shift—sometimes slightly, sometimes a lot. That’s not a problem; that’s how you learn what matters.

Summary:
Building an AI MVP in six weeks is realistic if you focus on a single goal and work in small steps. The process helps uncover the right questions. Each week is a checkpoint: what’s known, what’s working, and what to do next. You don’t need to aim for perfection; you need to keep moving, stay curious, and be open to change. If you're planning a project and want help shaping the work, I’m happy to talk through your options.
Getting from idea to MVP in six weeks is possible, and it's often the best way to test whether your AI concept is worth deeper investment. Define the problem clearly; find data that matters; test early and revise often. You don’t need perfection, you need progress—week by week, iteration by iteration.
