# Machine Learning Design Patterns

Machine learning isn't just about choosing the right model -- it's about applying the right design pattern to a problem. Design patterns originated in architecture: bridges, towers, doorways are all patterns; how they look in practice is a matter of the particular.

Let's break down key ML design patterns with a focus on applications to marketing, where ML can help optimise audience engagement, improve revenue generation, and gain customer insights. Once we understand the goal, applying the right ML design pattern will reduce the challenge from difficult to forecast R&D to predictable engineering.

## What Are ML Design Patterns?

Design patterns in ML are reusable solutions to common problems. Just like architecture design patterns (bridge, doorway, staircase, etc), or software design patterns (e.g., Singleton, Factory), ML design patterns help engineers structure the data and models appropriately. Design Patterns aren't specific algorithms but rather approaches to solving recurring challenges.

+ Recommender Pattern
    + Overview: Given a single observation, a recommender will suggest associations based on its training.
    + Examples: Next purchase suggestions, personalised content recommendations, discount recommendation.
    + Marketing example: To all customers, recommend an appropriate set of adverts.

+ Classifier Pattern
    + Overview: Given a single observation, classify it as one of a set of known examples seen during training.
    + Examples: Identifying fraudulent transactions, classify drought periods, identify customers with particular characteristics.
    + Marketing example: From all customers, identifying those high-value spenders and those who influence others.

+ Segmentation Pattern
    + Overview: Given a set of observations, separate them into distinct groups based on properties defined in the training process.
    + Examples: Customer segmentation by spending behaviour, identification of tissue type in medical scans.
    + Marketing example: Separate customers by spending habits.

+ Regression/Forecasting Pattern
    + Overview: Given a history of values, suggest future new values which follow the pattern.
    + Examples: Weather prediction, expected failure of parts in manufacturing processes, dynamic pricing.
    + Marketing example: For each customer, forecast future engagement based on previous behaviour.

+ Anomaly Detection
    + Overview: Given a set of observations, discover patterns to expect, then monitor for deviation.
    + Examples: Unexpected behaviour indicating identity theft or bot traffic, loss-of-customer prediction.
    + Marketing example: For each audience segment, monitor for changes in behaviour which suggest new approaches are needed.

+ Similarity Discovery
    + Overview: Given a set of observations, discover aspects of similarity or contrast.
    + Examples: Discover themes in customer feedback, trends in content, group images by content without descriptions.
    + Marketing example: Discovering related influencers based on engagement patterns or identifying complementary product categories for cross-promotion.

## Observations 
While all patterns are grounded in mathematical principles, their adoption and evolution have followed different historical paths:

+ Classifiers and Regression have been extensively studied in traditional statistics for decades, forming the foundation of many predictive modelling techniques.

+ Recommender Systems, though viable much earlier, surged in popularity with the rise of e-commerce and social media in the late 1990s and early 2000s, where personalised recommendations became a core competitive advantage.

+ Anomaly Detection, Similarity Discovery, and Segmentation only became widely practical with the advent of large-scale data collection and increased computational power, allowing businesses to extract deeper insights from vast datasets.

Now, a new generation of ML design patterns is emerging, driven by advances in AI and real-time decision-making. Routing, Reasoning, Planning, and Agentic AI are gaining prominence, but their long-term value will depend on distinguishing fundamental patterns from implementation details.

## Final Thoughts

Machine learning design patterns provide a structured way to think about problem-solving. Rather than getting lost in algorithms, focusing on patterns ensures smoother implementations and more scalable solutions.

Good engineering is about precision and structure, not trial and error. By understanding and applying ML design patterns, we replace uncertainty with predictable, measurable outcomes -- turning what might seem like complex R&D challenges into clear, repeatable engineering processes.
